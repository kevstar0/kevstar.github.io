    <h3>How much data will i need?</h3>
    <h4>The data you need depends on the number of devices you have</h4>
    <p>Due to new tech developing data has to be shared amongst TV's, Bluetooth, Wifi routers, phones, laptops and other tech available</p>
    <li>1 device (phone or laptop) = 12Gb</li>
    <li>2 (phone & laptop) = 12Gb</li>
    <li>3 devices (with a variation of 2 phones and 1 laptop or computer) = 36Gb</li>
    <li>4 < 5 = unlimited </li>
    <p>But that depends on the number of devices you may want to connect to</p>
    <p>Tv's, computers and laptops may use more bandwith (data) and may cap your connection short as we try to divide the same connection to other users</p>
